## Description

SPACE ADVENTURE is a decision based text adventure game. It has over 10 different endings depending on how you play, and the choices you make.

Set in the far future, you take the role of the captain of a non-descript spaceship, tasked with the duty of transporting you and your crew home. As you play, you will manage your finite and valuable resources while simultaneously being faced with many decisions, some morally challenging, and some more light-hearted in tone.

Can you navigate the vast expanse of space?

Will you and your crew make it home safely?

A malfunctioning AI, Aliens, Space-Pirates, and much more await you!
