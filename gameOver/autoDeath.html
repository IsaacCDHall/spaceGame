      <p>The ship jolts unexpectedly as an err in the autopilot causes you to swerve into an asteroid belt.</p>
      <p>However, nobody on the ship notices, since everyone is in cryosleep.</p>
      <p>The cold vacuume of space pulls you out of the ship, where your cryosleep will last much longer than you expected.</p>
