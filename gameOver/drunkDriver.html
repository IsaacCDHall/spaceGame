      <p>Near the end of one of the <em>best</em> parties of your life, someone asks:</p>
      <p>"If you're here, then who is flying the ship?"</p>
      <p>You stumble back to the cockpit in a hurry, after a collision rocks the ship.</p>
      <p>You arrive in time to see that you are about to crash into a trading ship. In a panic, you swerve away, crashing the ship into a trading station.</p>
