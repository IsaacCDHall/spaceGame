      <p>The sound of many people grumbling wakes you.</p>
      <p>You open your eyes to see that your crew has formed an angry mob.</p>
      <p>"Good Morning!" says your second in command, prompting a wry laughter from the mob.</p>
      <p>He continues, "We all decided that you are no longer fit to command."</p>
      <p>Before you can say anything, the mob drags you into the airlock and closes the safety door.</p>
      <p><i>Your ears ring from the crew's applause as you are ejected into the dark void of space...</i></p>
