      <p>A rain of projectiles shoots into your main thrusters, causing them to jam up.</p>
      <p>The trader and their crew board your ship, looting and pillaging, no wonder they were black-listed by the Intergalactic Trade Bureau.</p>
      <p>Leaving you without any supplies, or main thrusters, you know you won't last long in uncharted territory.</p>
